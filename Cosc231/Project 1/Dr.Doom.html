	<h2> Dr. Doom Facts and Trivia </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Doctor Doom's foot dive now causes a Hard knockdown that you can easily use to go into a combo, making it a great move to throw out every once in a while.	</li>
		<li> Both versions of his dive kick can be canceled into an air dash for additional pressure and mixups. The H version can be canceled into an air dash at a low height, while the S version has a much more strict timing requirement. Doing an air dash downward after slamming the opponent down allows you to OTG with s. </li>
		<li>Though Doom's dash isn't cancelable, you can cancel any of his ground attacks into a front or back dash. This can help you continue the pressure or retreat. If you jump cancel the dash, you can even combo. </li>
		<li>Doom can only use his Photon Array once per jump. As such, his dominance is much more suited to ground play. Make sure you mix in Plasma Beams and his Heavy Gun to keep people guessing when you do jump.</li>
		<li> Though Doom's dash isn't cancelable, you can cancel any of his ground attacks into a front or back dash. This can help you continue the pressure or retreat. If you jump cancel the dash, you can even combo. </li>
		<li> Doom can cancel grounded basic attacks into ground dashes immediately, and is the only character able to. If opponents are heavy on advance guards, dash cancel in and blow them up. </li>

	<h2> Why Have Dr. Doom in Your Lineup? </h2>
	<p> Dr.Doom is an interesting character, but also probably the single most played character in the entirety of UMVC3. This character can be renamed as Dr.Support, and to me anyways, is undisputed the best support character in the game. This Doctor has no bad assists and there is not a single character in this game that cannot, or does not benefit from Doom. I want to go deeper into this character, but there is not much else to say other than the fact that he is a staple character to this game, and possibly one of the characters that you have to learn to truly understand how UMVC3 works.
